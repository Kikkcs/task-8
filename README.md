Benefits

Enhanced Privacy: VPNs hide your IP address and online activities from ISPs, public Wi-Fi snoopers, and other third parties.
Stronger Security: Your data is encrypted, protecting sensitive information—like passwords and financial details—especially on public Wi-Fi networks.
Bypass Geo-Restrictions: VPNs let you access regional content or blocked websites by connecting to servers in other countries.
Protection Against Tracking: Advertisers and websites get less accurate data because your real IP and location are masked.
Safe Remote Access: Businesses use VPNs to allow employees to securely connect to internal servers from anywhere.

Limitations

Reduced Speed: Encryption and distant servers can slow down internet speed, especially on low-quality VPNs.
Trust Issues: Since your traffic passes through the VPN provider, you must trust them. A bad provider may log or misuse your data.
Not Complete Anonymity: A VPN can hide your IP, but it cannot stop tracking through cookies, accounts you’re logged into, or browser fingerprinting.
Some Websites/VPN Blocks: Streaming platforms, banks, or government networks may detect and block VPN traffic.
Potential Compatibility Issues: Certain apps, networks, or games may not work properly when a VPN is active.
Costs: Reliable VPNs often require a subscription, which can be expensive over time.
