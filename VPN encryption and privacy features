VPN Protocols & Encryption Algorithm
The protocol a VPN uses largely determines how your data is encrypted, how keys are exchanged, and how secure / efficient the tunnel is. Here are the main ones:
Protocol	Encryption / Cryptography	Strengths & Trade-offs

OpenVPN	Uses TLS (via OpenSSL) for key exchange, symmetric ciphers like AES. Commonly AES-256 is used. 
Very secure, widely audited, highly configurable. Slightly more complex; performance depends on implementation.

WireGuard	Uses ChaCha20 for encryption, Poly1305 for authentication, modern curve (Curve25519) for key exchange. 
Lightweight, very fast, simpler codebase (smaller attack surface), but traditionally lacked some advanced features.

IKEv2 / IPSec	Often paired with AES (AES-128 or AES-256), uses IPSec for authentication + encryption. 
Good performance, especially for mobile (can reconnect when networks change). Config complexity can be higher; depends on implementation.

L2TP / IPsec	L2TP itself doesn’t encrypt; encryption comes from IPSec (AES or 3DES) when combined. 
Fairly secure if properly implemented, but double encapsulation adds overhead. 

PPTP	Uses MPPE (128-bit) encryption. 
Very weak by modern standards. Often considered insecure; not recommended. 


Key Exchange & Forward Secrecy
VPNs use asymmetric cryptography (e.g., Diffie-Hellman, elliptic-curve) to securely exchange session keys.
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS): Many VPNs support PFS, which means session keys are ephemeral (not reused). If someone compromises one session, they can't decrypt past or future sessions.
Emerging: Post-quantum key exchange. Some VPNs (e.g. Windscribe) have started integrating quantum-resistant algorithms so that the key exchange is safer against future quantum computers. 
VPN providers are beginning to support PQE (Post-Quantum Encryption). 


No-Logs Policy
What is it? It means the VPN provider claims not to keep certain user-identifiable logs — such as connection timestamps, IP addresses, browsing history, or DNS queries. 
Why it's critical: Since your traffic is decrypted at the VPN server, the provider potentially has visibility. A strong no-logs policy protects your privacy from the provider itself. 

Real-world trust: The best VPNs get independent third-party audits to verify their no-logs claims. 
Caveats: “No-logs” doesn’t always mean zero data kept. Some minimal operational logs may be maintained (e.g., for debugging or preventing abuse), but privacy-focused providers limit these as much as possible. 

Leak Protection
DNS leak protection: Ensures your DNS queries (which convert domain names to IP addresses) go through the encrypted tunnel rather than your ISP’s DNS servers, preventing DNS-based snooping. 
Kill switch: A feature that cuts off your internet (or particular apps) if the VPN connection drops, preventing your traffic from leaking outside the VPN tunnel. 
Split tunneling: Lets you choose which traffic goes through the VPN and which doesn’t — useful for optimizing performance or using local services while still protecting sensitive traffic.

Server Security
Some VPN providers use RAM-only (diskless) servers: this means data can't be stored permanently and is wiped on reboot, improving security and reducing risk of persistent logs.
Full-disk encryption on VPN servers ensures server-side sensitive data (like certificates) remains encrypted even if the server is compromised. 
Obfuscation / Traffic masking: To hide the fact that you're using a VPN (helpful in restrictive networks), some VPNs use obfuscation techniques, or special protocols that mimic normal HTTPS traffic.

Privacy Enhancements / Additional Features
Browser fingerprinting protection: Some VPNs (e.g., Windscribe) add anti-fingerprinting features in their browser extensions to make it harder for websites to track you via device/browser fingerprints. 
Post-quantum security: As mentioned, some VPNs now support quantum-resistant key exchange to protect against future quantum-computing threats. 
Metadata minimization: Good VPNs try to minimize metadata (e.g., how long you connect, which server) to reduce privacy risk. Nym’s blog explains how even without content logs, metadata can be sensitive. 
Transparency reporting: Trustworthy VPNs may publish reports on data requests, server audits, and their internal policies.

Risks, Limitations, and Attack Vectors
Fingerprintability: Even with encryption, some VPN protocols (like OpenVPN) can be fingerprinted via packet size, timing, or other attributes. 
Metadata leaks: Encryption protects data content, but not necessarily all metadata (e.g., connection timing, packet sizes) — these can still leak and be analyzed. 
Quantum risk (in future): Without post-quantum cryptography, future quantum computers might crack traditional key-exchange mechanisms, making forward security critical.
Trust in the VPN provider: Even if technical encryption is strong, if the provider is untrustworthy (keeps logs, shares data, or is in a surveillance-heavy jurisdiction), your privacy could be compromised.
